# Module11 UFO
## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose
We helped Dana to build her webpage earlier in the module, but sheâ€™d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we want to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results
Dana's new webpage not only contains content introducing the possible UFO sites, but also a filter table which allow readers to filter out conditions based on their need. The filter tables contain colomns such as city, state, country and shape. For example, when typed in CA in the state section, the table will show only locations in CA. 
## Summary
However, I think the website does not contain enough filters. For example, we can also include time in the filter, representing how long did the UFO appear. We can also shorten the graph by putting more information in next page, by adding a "next page" button.
